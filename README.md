# 2019 Clayton Griffin OverCurrentRelay Paper repository

This repository contains the over current relay models used in the following paper submitted for the 2019 Clayton Griffin student paper award competition.

## How to simulate it?
Follow the steps below:

- Download the relaymodel.mo package `./Model/` found in the repository
- Load the package onto a Modelica Compliant software
- Open the 


### Cross Verification
Open the model This consists of 3 simulations, for each of the different relay types the 3 parameters must be set:
  - For Standard Inverse Relay, set the following parameters:
  -- 
  - For Very Inverse Relay
  ---
  - For Extremely Inverse Relay
  --
