# 2019 Clayton Griffin OverCurrentRelay Paper repository

This repository contains the over current relay models used in the following paper submitted for the 2019 Clayton Griffin student paper award competition.

## How to simulate it?
Follow the steps below:

- Download the relaymodel.mo package found [here]().
- Load the package onto a Modelica Compliant software
- Open the package 


### Cross Verification
Open the model This consists of 3 simulations, for each of the different relay types the 3 parameters must be set. The parameter window of the relay model should be filled like this:
![paramters] (). 
  - For Standard Inverse Relay, set the following parameters:
    -
  - For Very Inverse Relay
    -
  - For Extremely Inverse Relay
    -
 

### Application Example
Open the model This consists of 3 simulations, for each of the different relay types the 3 parameters must be set:
  - For Standard Inverse Relay, set the following parameters:
    -
  - For Very Inverse Relay
    -
  - For Extremely Inverse Relay
    -
